Mars Mining is a Create React App that displays the location of bots and mining nodes on a grid. Mars Mining is a front-end Application that retrieves its data from an endpoint provided by Headlight Talent Agency.

## My approach

I went with a vanilla JavaScript approach because it seemed like the fastest way to get started. I like to start simply
and make things more complicated over time.

I started out by...

## Tradeoffs I made

I decided to do X because it seemed like the fastest way to get going, and time was a factor obviously.

Though Framework Z is popular, I decided not to use it because I didn't feel like I was familiar enough to implement
everything in time.

## Functionality

Does it display bots and nodes correctly? Do bots update in roughly real-time? Are nodes displayed? If you’ve made any other functionality choices (e.g. adding a new feature or simplifying something), how well are they implemented?

## User Interface

How did you implement the user interface? Is it clear how to tell bots from nodes? Is it presented in a way you’d be comfortable sharing informally with co-workers? Are there any interesting choices taken?

## Communication 

Is your write-up meaningful and clear? Can we have a pretty good idea of what your code looks like based on the write-up alone? Can we tell why you made the decisions that you did? If you got stuck, is it clear what you got stuck on? Are there comments in the code?

## Extensibility and Future Features

How hard would it be to change your implementation if conditions changed? For example, if the grid was 100x100 instead of 20x20, how hard would that be to implement? What if bots could stack on top of each other? What if we wanted to add one of the “Going further” features - how hard would that be?
